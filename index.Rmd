# Welcome {-}

One of the most important parts of single-cell data analysis is visualization.
In fact, it could even be said that this is _the_ most important part of the analysis.
How else can we make Figure 1 of our _Nature_ papers without some sweet, sweet $t$-SNEs? (Or UMAPs.)
We need something to compete with the aesthetic appeal of a "representative" microscope image, after all.

This book will showcase various methods for visualizing single-cell data from a `SingleCellExperiment` object.
Each chapter focuses on a particular aspect of data visualization, 
starting with a brief analysis to set up the `SingleCellExperiment` before applying a range of plotting functions.
Readers can then pick and choose their poison in a bake-off between visualization philosophies.

All of the visualization packages presented here are available from the [Bioconductor project](https://bioconductor.org).
The major players are `r Biocpkg("scater")`, a trusty old workhorse for working with `SingleCellExperiment` objects;
`r Biocpkg("dittoSeq")`, a more recent package focusing on colorblind-friendly visualizations;
and `r Biocpkg("scDataviz")`, yet another upstart offering plotting capabilities.
If you're a Bioconductor package developer and you think you can do better, bring it. (With a PR.)

I'll finish with a quote from Keats, for those of us unfortunate enough to have study poetry in high school:

> "Beauty is truth, truth beauty,"--that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

Pretty much sums up the field.
