# Plotting gene expression

## Foreword 

If "CSI: Miami" has taught me anything, it's that Miami is made of palm trees.
On the sidewalks, in the parks, on people's lawns: they're basically weeds over there.
I mention this because I get a strange sense of déjà vu when I read single-cell papers:
just replace the palm trees with violin plots and boom! - you're in a bioinformatics version of South Beach.
Admittedly, violin plots do provide a compact yet informative visualization of the distribution of expression values, 
serving as a satisfactory, possibly even decent compromise between boxplots and histograms.
(Yes, I do know about ridgeline plots.
No, don't try to sell them to me.)
This chapter will show you how to contribute to the violin plot overdose in the single-cell field.
